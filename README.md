### About the Article

I found the article itneresting because it discusses how the workplace is adapting to meet the needs of COVID-19. For example,
it talks about how many managers who could previously keep a close eye on their subordinates now must shift to the agile approach
which has been used in software development for many years. It was also interesting to see how the changes are causing managers to shift 
the way they work with others as well. While they used to be able to tell people what to do, it has shifted to more of those people telling 
them or asking them for help. Managers now must also be more available than ever so that their teams remain productive and successful.

I find article interesting because it invokes the ongoing pandemic with agile development. How the pandemic affected the way companies operate for the better is really cool, and a nice outcome from an otherwise unfortunate situation.
